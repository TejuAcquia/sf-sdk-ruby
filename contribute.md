## Expectations
This is an Open project, it does not mean that we have 24/7 support for it.
The best way to make sure that we accept your bugfix or add in a feature you
want is still to make a pull request and link it in the issue. Include
some reasons how to reproduce or even better, make sure the bug is tested
and passes greatly increases your chances for the change to get committed.
